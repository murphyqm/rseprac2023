# Omniglobe file fragment

(i) the `fname_out` variable should contain something like this: `/path/to/folder/Ozone_2001-01-01_0000.png`, where `/path/to/folder/` is a directory name or path that the Omniglobe software will scan for PNG files (the `Home` variable), and `0000` is a string (the `Frame` variable). This is a number provided by the `simhour` variable, then formatted to always have at least 4 digits with leading zeroes if a shorter number is provided and converted to a string (eg `simhour = 12` -> `Frame = "0012"`).

(ii) the `Home` variable and `simhour` variable are not defined in this fragment. Also, the savefig statement will need a prefix (eg. `plt`) unless it was imported directly from `matplotlib.pyplot` or redefined (not advised). Since the format `.png` is specified in the file name, it doesn't need to be defined in the `savefig` function call; however, the DPI of the figure hasn't been defined and the default stored in rc.Params may not be adequate for the Omniglobe visualiser (unless this is defined when the Figure was created, outside of this fragment). There is also a possible issue with a `TimeStamp` value loaded earlier from the NetCDF file being overwritten (see the comment "`# this could be in the nc file`")
